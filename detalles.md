# Details

> this file is used for see all details found in the project after some months

1. The project its created in _challenge_ folder and within challengeApp, so this is unregular.
2. `.gitignore` its not aplicable, beacuse its inside a folder is not in root directory.
3. Regularly the project must run with `npm start` or another script referring to _package.json_.

## TODO

1. Module divisions in api
2. Add better UI to Front
3. Watch that everything works and eliminate that does not works.
